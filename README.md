# Procreate Viewer
I use my computer to store all of my backups of my [Procreate](https://procreate.art) documents (since they seem reluctant to add actual cloud saving), but
I can never figure out which documents are which, so I created this app to alleviate this dilemma.

This app contains a document-based viewer that associates itself with the `.procreate` file format. It also contains a Quick Look
preview and thumbnail generator, all written in Swift and Cocoa. Please note that since there is almost no documentation on how
these new generator api's work, they might be broken.

This app uses the Swift Package Manager to handle our sole dependency, [ZipFoundation](https://github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation).

## Procreate File Format
All `.procreate` files are actually standard ZIP files. So extracting them leads to something like this:
```
- (Multiple folders named randomly via UUID)
  - Contains .chunk files, presumably the actual pixel canvas data for the document.
- QuickLook [Folder]
  - Thumbnail.png - Low-quality screenshot generated by Procreate.
- video [Folder]
  - segments [Folder]
    - segment-X.mp4, where X is a number starting from 1. These are most likely the timelapse files.
- Document.archive - ???
```

We simply extract the zip file in memory, and display the `Thumbnail.png` found in the file. Notice how I said these thumbnails are
'low-quality', and even though they may seem low-quality when blown up on a Retina display like most iPads, these tend to be more
than servicable for thumbnail usage.
